          <h2>The Project</h2>
          <p>
            New advancements in aerospace engineering, ecosystem management, and
            radiation shielding have finally made what was once a dream a
            reality. We've already begun the process of establishing a
            settlement with Hermes 3 transporting materials and Hermes 4
            transporting the first set of crew that began building the Mars
            settlement.
          </p>

          <h2>The Future</h2>
          <p>
            The Mars colony was created in an effort to provide an alternative
            to the earth, which has been overpopulated and overexploited. The
            colony is a place where humans can live and work in peace, free from
            the risks of famine, disease, and war. The colony is also a place
            where people can live and work with a greater sense of purpose,
            knowing that they are building a better future for the next
            generation. The colony is a technological marvel that has taken
            decades to complete. It is a self-sustaining, sustainable, and
            scalable community of habitats and eco-systems that can house up to
            2,000 people. The colony is made up of two domes: one is the
            Biosphere and the other is the Settlement. The Biosphere is the
            self-contained habitat that provides all the air, water, food, and
            energy needed to sustain life. The Settlement is the place where
            people live and work. The settlement is made up of clusters of
            habitation pods that are clustered together by specialty. The
            settlement also has communal spaces where people can meet and spend
            time together. The colony is a fully enclosed environment, so
            residents have to wear a suit whenever they leave the Settlement.
            The Mars colony is the future of humanity.
